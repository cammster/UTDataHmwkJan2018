    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Highest Overall Passing Scores are linked to charter schools with less than 2000 students\n",
    "    2. Students' reading scores are higher than math scores, regardless of school type or size\n",
    "    3. Dollars spent per student do not directly correlate with higher overall passing scores\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Assumption:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Overall Passing Rates are calculated as an average of math and reading; this does not indicate whether students\n",
    "       are passing BOTH reading and math\n",
    "    2. Bin sizes have been set to accomodate test data sets and may require adjustment-please review and update if necessary\n",
    "    3. Passing Threshold has been set at 65, please update the passthreshold variable if necessary\n",
